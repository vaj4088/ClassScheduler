# ClassScheduler
Personal Class Scheduler, also known as ClassScheduler - Schedules courses for a student at a university or college, and other purposes.

REPOSITORY

The primary repository for this program is at Source Forge.  The Source Forge project page is located at:

                       https://sourceforge.net/projects/personalclassscheduler/?source=directory

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Java 1.5 (JRE or JDK 1.5 or higher) is required.
ClassScheduler has been tested with Java 1.7 (Java 7) but has been written for use with Java 1.5 and up.

SHORT DESCRIPTION

The primary purpose of the ClassScheduler program is scheduling courses for a student at a university or college, but it could be used for other purposes such as scheduling part time employees to cover shifts at a business.

LONG DESCRIPTION

This program handles the scheduling of classes for a college student. Unless overridden by the user, this program provides usable schedules and avoids schedule conflicts and closed sections. The user chooses the session (semester or quarter) and the courses, and optionally blocks out any personal time needed for jobs, child care, sleeping, eating, etc.

Access to schools' schedules is via plugins that any Java programmer can write. Some plugins are provided, including one that can use comma separated values suitable for any college or university, and including one for demonstration purposes.

Plugins can access a school's web-based schedule of classes, but require maintenance because the web pages change. It is hoped that the open source nature of this software will lead to wider authoring and maintenance of plugins.

Some users have commented that this program provides "prettier" printed schedules than their school's own web page can provide.

This program can be considerably faster than using a school's web site.  The program does not need to download images, style files, scripts or other superfluous data.  In one test in January 2015 using the University of Texas at Arlington web site, over 200 web accesses were necessary to access the web site using a browser, whereas less than 20 accesses were needed using this program.

Up through 27 March 2015, all of the writing of this program has been by Ian Shef who may be contacted via email:  ianshef@yahoo.com
